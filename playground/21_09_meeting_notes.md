- Weird pump pressure on 20230918_1207_steady_LF_KC_15_stdy:
    - Low flow stop check
        - He says it looks like we have too little pressure inside the pressure tank
    - Self learning mode - read about it
- Don't trust pressure reading below 0,1 bars
- Temperature not useful:
    - The behaviour will be different from the real world but it might still be useful.
        - Get clarification on which scenarios the water temperature increases.
    - Also expect different results if we run the test all afternoon because the motor is heated up
- Moving test setup to AU:
    - If we are the only ones working with setup it is okay. But Jesper may also need it.
    - Maybe ok if Jesper is ok with it.
- More automated tests:
    - Done by adding actuators
    - Controllable valves:
        - Done with mneumatic actuator
    - Jorge will discuss with Mads
- Bugs in PLC code:
    - CV0202 valve not getting info: We can add it
    - PT0203 pressure sensor incorrect: OK to fix it
- Variables:
    - act_modes: Stands for actual mode. He sent an excel sheet
    - DBB_ANTI_CYCLING_TRI: Scala has built-in leakage detection based on number of cycles. Maybe this is related to that algorithm. He said something about the count going to 40 if leakage was detected.
    - DBB_ANTI_CYCLING_TIM:
